# Łoś Ultraproduct Theorem and Ultracategories #

This is an expository paper on the *Łoś Ultraproduct Theorem and Ultracategories* that I wrote for my Master's in Mathematics project at Miami University.
Here, I give a brief introduction to mathematical logic and category theory.
From here, I combine these two fields of mathematics to define the *categorical ultraproduct* and use this to prove the *Łoś Ultraproduct Theorem*
Then, I cover the definition of an *ultracategory* and discuss their use in proving *Strong Conceptual Completeness*.
This is not original research and the purpose of this project was to explore the Łoś Ultraproduct Theorem and ultracategories with out assuming any knowledge of category theory or mathematical logic.
